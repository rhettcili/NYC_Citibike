The purpose of this analysis was to create visualizations that helped better understand the Citibike data. Such as who was riding the most and most popular riding times for these bikes.

## Some findings

![]
Here we can see that the majority of these bike trips have a duration between 0 and 1 hours.

And here we can see the most popluar days of the week for these bike trips.

## Summary

These findings do show us that the majority of these trips are taken by males, and usually toward the end of the week. But regardless of gender, the vast majority of these trips are less than an hour long. Two additional visualizations that this dataset could certainly use are the trip durations broken down by age, as well as the overall rider count by age. These would open more comparison opportunities within the dataset for a deeper understanding of some aspects of this data.
